Explanation of Blockchain Implementation

Requirement:
Create a blockchain implementation utilizing knowledge of linked lists and hashing. The blockchain is a series of records (blocks), each containing a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.

Summary:
The implementation comprises two primary classes:

Block: Acts as the building block of the blockchain, akin to a node in a linked list. Each block holds transaction data, a timestamp, and the hash of the previous block.
BlockChain: Functions as a linked list to chain the blocks together. This class includes methods for appending new blocks (append), determining the blockchain's size (size), and converting the blockchain into a list (to_list).

Time Complexity Analysis:
append Method: O(1). Adding a new block to the blockchain is a constant time operation, as it involves prepending a new block to the head of the list.
size Method: O(n). This method requires traversing the entire blockchain to count the number of blocks, which takes linear time relative to the length of the chain.
to_list Method: O(n). Similar to size, this method involves traversing the entire blockchain and thus also takes linear time.
Overall, the combined time complexity for these operations is O(1 + n + n) â‰ˆ O(n).

Space Complexity Analysis:
The space complexity for the blockchain is O(n), as each block in the blockchain occupies constant space. The total space used by the blockchain is directly proportional to the number of blocks it contains.

Conclusion:
This blockchain implementation effectively utilizes the principles of linked lists, with each block connected to the next. It leverages hashing for security and integrity of the blocks. The linear time and space complexities make it suitable for scenarios where the number of transactions (blocks) is manageable and where the integrity and chronological ordering of transactions are paramount.
