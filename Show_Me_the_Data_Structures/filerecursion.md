Explanation of File Recursion

Requirement:
The task is to create a function for identifying all files ending with ".c" within a given directory and its subdirectories.

Summary:
The find_files function is implemented to achieve this, accepting a file extension (suffix) and a directory path (path) as parameters. This function employs recursion to search through the specified directory and all nested subdirectories, collecting files that match the given suffix. These files are accumulated in a list and returned.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is primarily driven by the number of elements (files and folders) encountered in the directory structure. It can be considered as O(n), where n is the total count of these elements.
Each call to os.listdir() contributes to this complexity, as it iterates over each item in a directory. Whether the directory structure is flat or deeply nested, the function processes each item exactly once.
In practical scenarios, such as a folder containing several files or a deeply nested directory structure, the algorithm scales linearly with the number of items. This makes the overall time complexity O(n).

Space Complexity:
Input Space:
Suffix (str): O(1)
Path (str): O(1)
The recursion depth and average number of directories at each level contribute to the input space complexity, making it O(depth * Average number of directories per level).

Auxiliary Space:
The recursion uses the call stack, where space is needed for each level of recursion. The maximum depth of the recursion determines the space used in the call stack, which is O(depth).
Total Space Complexity: O(depth * Average number of directories per level + depth) â‰ˆ O(depth * Average number of directories per level)
This implementation provides an efficient way to traverse directories and subdirectories to find files with a specific extension, maintaining good scalability and efficiency in terms of time and space complexity.
