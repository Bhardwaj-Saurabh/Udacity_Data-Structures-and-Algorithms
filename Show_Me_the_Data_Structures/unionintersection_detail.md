Explanation of Union and Intersection of Two LinkedLists

Requirement:
Create functions to compute the union and intersection of two linked lists and return the results as new linked lists.

Summary:
The implementation involves converting the elements of both linked lists into two sets. Python's built-in set operations are then used to find the union and intersection of these sets. The resultant sets are used to create new linked lists, named Unions and Intersections, which are returned as the respective results of the union and intersection operations.

Time Complexity Analysis:
LinkedList Methods (append, size, __str__): These methods operate in linear time, O(n) for the first linked list and O(m) for the second.
Union Operation: In the worst case (all elements are unique), the time complexity is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two linked lists, respectively.

Intersection Operation: In the worst case (all elements are the same in both lists), the time complexity is O(n), assuming n = m.
Space Complexity Analysis:
Union Operation: In the worst case (all elements are unique), the space complexity is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two linked lists, respectively.

Intersection Operation: In the worst case (all elements are the same in both lists), the space complexity is O(n), assuming n = m.

Conclusion:
This approach efficiently computes the union and intersection of two linked lists using set operations. The time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input linked lists, making it efficient for moderately sized lists. The space complexity is also linear, depending on the uniqueness of the elements in the lists. This method provides an effective way to handle common operations on linked lists in a manner that is both intuitive and efficient.
