Task0:
Answer: O(1)
Analysis: The Worst-Case senerio for task0 is always same regardless of number of input as we are only selecting the first and last row of the dataset.


Task1:
Answer: O(2n log n)
Analysis: The worst case senerio for task1 is Big o(n) as loop runs times twice with sorted method. 
in addition, we used len method but that can be ignored compared to for loop. 

Task2:
Answer: O(n)
Analysis: The worst case senerio for task2 is Big o(n) as loop runs n times. 

Task3:  
Answer: O(2n log n)
Analysis: The worst case senerio for task3 is Big o(n) as 2 loop runs n times with sorted method.

Task3:  
Answer: O(6n log n)
Analysis: The worst case senerio for task4 is Big o(n) as 6 loop runs n times with sorted method.
