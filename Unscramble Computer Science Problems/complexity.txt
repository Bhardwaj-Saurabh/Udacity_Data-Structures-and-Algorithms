Task0:
Answer: O(1)
Analysis: The Worst-Case senerio for task0 is always same regardless of number of input as we are only selecting the first and last row of the dataset.

Task1:
Answer: O(n)
Analysis: The worst case senerio for task1 is Big O(n) as 2 loops run n times. 
in addition, we used len method but that can be ignored compared to for loop. 

Task2:
Answer: O(n)
Analysis: The worst case senerio for task2 is Big o(n) as 2 different loops run n times. 

Task3:  
Answer: O(n log n)
Analysis: The worst case senerio for task3 is Big O(n log n) as one loop runs n times with sorted method.

Task4:  
Answer: O(n log n)
Analysis: The worst case senerio for task4 is Big o(n) as 3 loop runs n times with sorted method.
